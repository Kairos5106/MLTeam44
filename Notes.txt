- What is a problem that we might need to solve?
Possible topics:

1. Skin cancer
2. Lung cancer
3. TB detection
4. Heart disease
5. Anxiety

Types of machine learning:
1. Unsupervised learning
2. Supervised learning (most desirable, easy)
3. Reinforcement learning

Steps in doing a machine learning project:
1. Import required libraries
2. Data processing
	i. Process different valued-variables
	ii. Do exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Data visualization
4. Training models
	- can have many different models
5. Evaluating models
6. Choosing the most accurate model

- Stroke
	- Definition: A loss of blood flow to part of the brain, which damages brain tissue
	- Types of stroke
		- Ischemic stroke		: Blood clot blocks an artery in the brain (causes death of brain tissues)
		- Hermorrhagic stroke 	: Blood vessel in the brain ruptures cause hemorrhage (blood flows into skull)
	- Effects of stroke
		- Loss of brain function within minutes
			- Movement, thought, emotion processing
	- Statistics and facts of stroke
		- 2020: 1 in 6 deaths from cardiovascular disease was from stroke
		- Stroke reduces mobility in more than half of stroke survivors
	- Factors inducing risk of getting a stroke
		- High blood pressure
		- High cholesterol
		- Smoking
		- Obesity
		- Diabetes
